# Easy_Scanner
Easy network vulnerability scanner.

Easyscanner is a free tool used for vulnerability checking, port scanning, and network mapping. Since 
most people don't have a clear idea about the target, this network scanning tool identifies specific 
targets automatically. Easyscaner can be invaluable for both optimizing and protecting networks and 
information. there are many free-to-use scanners on the internet, but they are not easy to use. As an 
example for beginners, it's hard to use nmap since they have to remember the correct argument. 
Easyscaner is very easy to use because of the user-friendly interface and it can be used to perform a lot 
of scan types.
